# What is Supervisely Agent?

Supervisely Agent is a tiny docker container that allows you to connect your computational resources (cloud server or PC) to the platform. You can run any plugin from web interface (for exmaple import, DTL, Neural Network training/inference/deploy).

After you run Agent on your computer, Agent will automatically connect your server to Supervisely platform. You will see this information in "Cluster" page.
